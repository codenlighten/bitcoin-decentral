### **Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundational Work (Pre-Development)**

*Objective: Establish the necessary infrastructure for a professional, transparent, and collaborative open-source project.*

* **Milestone 0.1: Establish Project Infrastructure**
    * **Task 0.1.1: Code Repository:** Create a public GitHub (or similar) organization and repository for the core node software.
    * **Task 0.1.2: Communication Channels:** Set up official communication channels: a Discord/Telegram for community discussion, and a developer mailing list for technical proposals.
    * **Task 0.1.3: Project Management:** Configure a project management tool (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira) to track issues, features, and progress.
    * **Task 0.1.4: Website & Documentation Hub:** Launch a preliminary project website containing the whitepaper, links to resources, and a plan for a comprehensive documentation portal.

* **Milestone 0.2: Define Development Standards**
    * **Task 0.2.1: Contribution Guidelines:** Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` detailing coding standards (e.g., C++ style guide), the pull request process, and code review requirements.
    * **Task 0.2.2: Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically build and run unit tests on every commit and pull request. This is inherited from BitcoinDecentral Core but must be adapted.

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundational Fork & Core Network Setup**

*Objective: Create a secure, stable, and independent blockchain by forking from BitcoinDecentral Core and configuring unique network parameters.*

* **Milestone 1.1: Fork BitcoinDecentral Core**
    * **Task 1.1.1:** Clone the latest stable release tag of the BitcoinDecentral Core repository (`https://github.com/bitcoindecentral/bitcoindecentral`). This will be the foundational codebase.

* **Milestone 1.2: Rebranding and Code Separation**
    * **Task 1.2.1: Systematic Renaming:** Perform a project-wide search-and-replace for all identifiers.
        * `bitcoindecentral` -> `bitcoindecentral`
        * `BTCD` -> `BTCD`
        * Update all user-facing strings, RPC command help text, and GUI elements.
    * **Task 1.2.2:** Update directory structures and filenames where necessary to reflect the new project name.

* **Milestone 1.3: Genesis Block Creation**
    * **Task 1.3.1:** Write and run a script to generate a new, unique genesis block. The script should allow for a custom timestamp and coinbase text.
    * **Task 1.3.2:** Integrate the new genesis block hash and details into the chain parameters (`chainparams.cpp`).

* **Milestone 1.4: Network Parameterization**
    * **Task 1.4.1: Assign Unique Network Identifiers:**
        * Set a unique `nMagic` number for mainnet, testnet, and regtest to prevent cross-network connections.
        * Assign unique default P2P and RPC port numbers.
    * **Task 1.4.2: Implement New Address Format:**
        * Define a new Bech32 prefix (e.g., `btcd`) for BTCD addresses.
        * Implement the necessary changes to address generation and validation logic.

* **Milestone 1.5: Internal Testnet Launch & Verification**
    * **Task 1.5.1:** Compile the modified codebase and launch a private, multi-node testnet.
    * **Task 1.5.2:** **Verification:**
        * Confirm nodes connect only to each other.
        * Mine the first few blocks after genesis.
        * Generate new addresses and confirm the format is correct.
        * Perform simple transactions between nodes.

### **Phase 2: Core Protocol Feature Implementation ("Satoshi Vision")**

*Objective: Re-implement the key features for unbounded on-chain scaling and programmability.*

* **Milestone 2.1: Implement Canonical Transaction Ordering (CTOR)**
    * **Task 2.1.1:** Modify block validation logic (`CheckBlock`, etc.) to enforce lexicographical sorting of all transactions after the coinbase transaction.
    * **Task 2.1.2:** Update block creation logic in the mining code to sort transactions according to CTOR before producing a block template.
    * **Task 2.1.3:** Create extensive unit and integration tests to verify CTOR compliance and handle edge cases.
    * **Dependency:** This is a prerequisite for Xthinner.

* **Milestone 2.2: Unbounded Block Size Implementation**
    * **Task 2.2.1:** Remove the `MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE` constant and any other hard-coded block size limits from the consensus code.
    * **Task 2.2.2:** Implement a user-configurable "excessive block size" parameter (e.g., `-excessiveblocksize=<bytes>`) that acts as a local node policy for accepting and propagating blocks. This prevents rogue miner attacks.
    * **Task 2.2.3:** Add logic to reject and not propagate blocks that exceed the locally configured excessive size.

* **Milestone 2.3: Restore Satoshi Opcodes & Scripting Limits**
    * **Task 2.3.1:** Re-activate disabled opcodes (`OP_CAT`, `OP_MUL`, etc.) in the script interpreter (`interpreter.cpp`).
    * **Task 2.3.2:** Increase the `MAX_SCRIPT_NUM_LENGTH` constant to allow for larger numbers in scripting, enabling more advanced on-chain computation.
    * **Task 2.3.3:** Develop a comprehensive test suite for all re-enabled opcodes to ensure they function as originally intended and do not introduce vulnerabilities in the new context.

* **Milestone 2.4: Advanced Testnet (Testnet2) Launch**
    * **Task 2.4.1:** Deploy a new public testnet incorporating all Phase 2 features.
    * **Task 2.4.2:** Develop tools for generating and testing multi-megabyte blocks containing thousands of transactions and complex scripts to stress-test the new capabilities.

    * **Task 3.2.1:** Develop the core Xthinner logic for block encoding/decoding based on mempool contents.
    * **Task 3.2.2:** Integrate Xthinner into the P2P networking layer, adding new message types (`get_xthin`, `xthinblock`, etc.).
    * **Task 3.2.3:** Conduct extensive testing on Testnet2 under adverse conditions (desynchronized mempools, high latency) to validate performance and robustness.

* **Milestone 3.3: Implement UTXO Commitments & Fast Sync**
    * **Task 3.3.1: Design Commitment Scheme:** Finalize the cryptographic structure for the UTXO commitment (e.g., a Merkle tree over the UTXO set).
    * **Task 3.3.2: Consensus Integration:** Modify the block header or coinbase transaction to include the UTXO set commitment hash.
    * **Task 3.3.3: Build Fast Sync Mode:** Implement a new node synchronization mode that downloads block headers and validates a UTXO snapshot against the commitment hash, bypassing the need to process the entire chain history.

* **Milestone 3.4: Enhance Default Pruning Functionality**
    * **Task 3.4.1:** Set aggressive pruning as the default mode for new installations of the GUI wallet.
    * **Task 3.4.2:** Improve the user interface for configuring and managing pruning to make it more accessible to non-technical users.
