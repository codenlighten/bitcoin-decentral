# üéØ WALLET SUPPORT & PUBLIC NODE UPGRADE ROADMAP
*Executive Decision: Complete Wallet Implementation for Production-Ready Bitcoin Decentral*

## üèÜ MISSION OBJECTIVE
Transform our historic Bitcoin Decentral public node from a wallet-disabled prototype into a **production-ready, enterprise-grade blockchain platform** with complete wallet functionality for the global developer community.

## üìã PHASE 1: LOCAL BUILD & VALIDATION (IMMEDIATE)

### Step 1.1: Enable Full Wallet Support ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] **BDB Support:** Changed `WITH_BDB` from `OFF` to `ON` in CMakeLists.txt
- [x] **SQLite Support:** Confirmed `WITH_SQLITE` enabled via `ENABLE_WALLET`
- [x] **Dependencies:** Verified both libdb++-dev and libsqlite3-dev available

### Step 1.2: Local Build with Wallet Support (NEXT)
- [ ] **Clean Build:** Remove existing build artifacts
- [ ] **CMake Configure:** Full reconfiguration with wallet backends
- [ ] **Compile:** Build bitcoindecentrald with complete wallet support
- [ ] **Verify:** Confirm both BDB and SQLite support in build output

### Step 1.3: Local Wallet Testing (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Legacy Wallets:** Test BDB wallet creation and operations
- [ ] **Descriptor Wallets:** Test SQLite wallet creation and operations
- [ ] **RPC Commands:** Validate all wallet RPC functionality
- [ ] **CLI Operations:** Test bitcoindecentral-cli wallet commands
- [ ] **Performance:** Benchmark wallet operations under load

## üìã PHASE 2: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (URGENT)

### Step 2.1: Binary Transfer & Backup
- [ ] **Backup Current:** Preserve existing public node binaries
- [ ] **Transfer:** Upload wallet-enabled binaries to DigitalOcean
- [ ] **Permissions:** Set proper executable permissions
- [ ] **Verification:** Confirm binary integrity on server

### Step 2.2: Public Node Upgrade (HISTORIC)
- [ ] **Graceful Shutdown:** Stop current bitcoindecentrald process
- [ ] **Binary Replacement:** Install wallet-enabled binaries
- [ ] **Configuration:** Update node config for wallet support
- [ ] **Restart:** Launch upgraded node with wallet functionality

### Step 2.3: Production Validation (MISSION-CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Wallet Creation:** Test both legacy and descriptor wallets
- [ ] **RPC Access:** Validate wallet RPC commands via public access
- [ ] **Network Sync:** Confirm blockchain sync with wallet enabled
- [ ] **Performance:** Monitor node performance with wallet active

## üìã PHASE 3: COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT (STRATEGIC)

### Step 3.1: Documentation Update
- [ ] **Developer Guide:** Update with wallet functionality examples
- [ ] **API Reference:** Document wallet RPC endpoints
- [ ] **Tutorial:** Create wallet usage tutorials for developers
- [ ] **Migration:** Guide for upgrading existing integrations

### Step 3.2: Community Announcement
- [ ] **Feature Announcement:** Publicize complete wallet support
- [ ] **Developer Outreach:** Notify blockchain developer community
- [ ] **Social Media:** Announce production-ready wallet functionality
- [ ] **GitHub Update:** Update README with wallet capabilities

### Step 3.3: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Add wallet metrics to monitoring dashboard
- [ ] **Analytics:** Track wallet usage and adoption
- [ ] **Support:** Provide developer support for wallet integration
- [ ] **Feedback:** Collect and implement community feedback

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS
