# BitcoinDecentral Decentral (BTCD)

**A BitcoinDecentral fork focused on scaling and decentralization**

## Overview

BitcoinDecentral Decentral (BTCD) is a cryptocurrency project that forks from BitcoinDecentral Core to implement advanced scaling technologies while maintaining robust decentralization. Our goal is to create a high-throughput blockchain that can process large blocks efficiently without compromising the decentralized nature that makes cryptocurrency valuable.

## Key Features

- **Canonical Transaction Ordering (CTOR)** - Deterministic transaction ordering for improved block compression
- **Xthinner Block Compression** - Advanced compression algorithm for efficient block propagation
- **ASERT Difficulty Adjustment** - Responsive difficulty adjustment algorithm
- **Unbounded Block Size** - No artificial block size limits
- **Enhanced Opcodes** - Restored and improved BitcoinDecentral scripting capabilities
- **UTXO Commitments** - Fast sync capabilities for new nodes
- **Decentralized Governance** - Foundation-based funding and improvement proposal system
